# My-First-Deep-Q-Network

This is my first deep Q network using gym ("CartPole-v0") simulation environment

Training target: Making the CartPole stand upright as long as possible

Method: Mapping the states to actions by a deep ANN, selecting the action according to reward by Q-learning

-STATE: [horizontal position, horizontal velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity]
-ACTION: (move right, move left)
