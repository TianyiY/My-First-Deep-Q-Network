This is my first deep Q network using gym ("CartPole-v0") simulation environment

Training target: Making the CartPole stand upright as long as possible

Method: Mapping the states to actions by a deep ANN, selecting the action according to reward by Q-learning

-NUMBER OF STATE: 4
-NUMBER OF ACTION: 2
